# TelChat - A simple chat application using only telnet
I made this project to learn more about C++ and compare it to my experience with sockets in rust. I'ts a simple chat application that uses only telnet to connect to the server, you can choose a username and then chat with other users connected to the server.

Work in progress for now :)

## Setup
Use the run.sh script to compile, you have to have cmake and a c++ compiler installed. The server runs on port 8080
